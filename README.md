# HEIC to PNG Converter for Plex

Project to convert iPhone/iPad pictures in HEIC format to PNG, making sure that the quality of the image is retained as much as possible and preserving the creation date. Plex is unable to render pictures in HEIC format so we need to convert the files to PNG/TIFF/JPG/JPEG format.

# Setting up

make sure you are inside the folder where HEIC files are located.
Now create a folder called `converted_images`
convert the `conversion_script.bash` script to executable
run using: `bash conversion_script.bash`

It will convert all the HEIC files to PNG
